CCTF - in/s/ane
===============

Solutions to problems, written by team in/s/ane during the [2015 CCTF](http://play.camsctf.com) challenge.

This was the first CTF competition that we participated in that implemented the _Interact_ feature, which allowed teams to attack others for the opportunity of decreasing the score of the other team. Because of this, our team decided to stay in the Top 10, and only submit flags occasionally to give off the impression that we had not solved any other problems. Then in the last 10 minutes of the competition, we submitted flags for all the problems that we had solved and rose to a sweet **10566** points to claim 1st place!
